## How to use

Include a script tag in your HTML with the src attribute pointing to this URL:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/viberfoner/autocapture/lib/autocapture.js
Make sure the script is after the p5.js script, and before your sketch script. That's it! Your sketch will run and then a video of 180 frames will appear. More features coming soon!

Due to an issue with ffmpeg.wasm, the maximum number of frames seems to be 180. If anyone knows a solution to this, please make a pull request or submit an issue!
